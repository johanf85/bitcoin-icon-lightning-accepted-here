# bitcoin-icon-lightning-accepted-here

Found a vector format SVG of below image on [https://github.com/lncm/ideas/blob/master/bitcoin-lightning-accepted.svg](https://github.com/lncm/ideas/blob/master/bitcoin-lightning-accepted.svg), however the font wasn't a path, but refered to the font Ubuntu that had to be installed on the viewers computer. I changed the image to a svg in which the text is a path.

Below is the SVG image:
